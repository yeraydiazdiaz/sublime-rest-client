# 1.1.0 (2024-05-02)

- Add ability to set host settings. Users can now define settings that will only be
applied to a specific host. These will need to be specified under `host_settings` in the
REST Client settings, e.g.:

```json
{
    "host_settings": {
        "localhost:8080": {
            "disable_ssl_validation": true
        }
    }
}
```

- Allow disabling of SSL validation. This is *not* recommended for general use as it
can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks, however, in specific circumstances it can be
necessary so it is allowed only as a per-host setting as described above.
