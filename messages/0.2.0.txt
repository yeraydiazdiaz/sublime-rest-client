# 0.2.0 (2022-07-19)

- Encode payload as UTF-8: urllib3 will default to encoding payloads as latin-1,
when the payload has characters out of the range urllib3
will raise an error. Encode the payload as utf-8 as suggested.

- Show errors on new tab: Previously errors would print a message to the status bar and
the traceback to the developer console, now message and traceback are printed to a new
tab.
